This project involves analyzing the SEEK job market dataset to extract insights and trends relevant to the Australian job market. Using Python and data analysis libraries, I explored, cleaned, and visualized the dataset to help users understand job distribution, salary ranges, sector trends, and more. This project showcases my ability to work with real-world data, apply advanced data analytics techniques, and derive actionable insights through visualization.
